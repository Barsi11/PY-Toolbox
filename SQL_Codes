Select Pizzas.size,count(order_detail.order_datail_id) As order_count
from Pizzas oin order_deatails
on Pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id
group by Pizzas.size order by order_count DECS;

7) List the 5 most ordered pizza type along with there Quantities.

Select pizza_type.name,
SUM(order_detail.quentity)
from pizza_type join Pizzas
on Pizza_type.pizza_type_id = Pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_details.pizza_id = Pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.name order by quantity DECS limit 5;

Intermediate:

8)Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
SELECT Pizza_type.category,
sum(Order_details.quantity) as quentity
from pizza_type join pizza
on pizza_type.pizza_type_id = Pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_detaoils.pizza_id = Pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_type.category order by quantity DESC;


9)Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
SELECT hour(order_time), count(order_id)
from Order
Group by hour(order_time);


10)Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
SELECT category , count(name)
from Pizza_type
group by category;


11)Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
Select avg(quantity)from
(Select Order.order_date, sum(oder_detail.quantity)
from order join order_detail
on order.order_id = order_detail.order_id
group by order.order_date;) as order_quentaty;


12)Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
Select Pizza_type.name,

from pizza_type join Pizzas
on Pizzas.pizza_type_id = Pizza_type.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_details.pizza_id = Pizza.pizza_id
group by pizza_type.name order by revenue desc limit 3;

13)Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
Select Pizza_type.category,
(sum(order_details.quentity * Pizzas.price) / (Select sum(Order_detail.quentity* Pizzas.price) AS Total sales
from Order_details
join Pizzas 
on Pizzas.pizza_type_id = order_detail.pizza_id)*100) as revenue
from pizza_type join Pizzas
on Pizzas.pizza_type_id = Pizza_type.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_details.pizza_id = Pizza.pizza_id
group by pizza_type.category order by revenue desc;
